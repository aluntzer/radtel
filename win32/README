To create the installer you need the following prerequisites
 - install WiX Toolset v3:
	https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/releases/tag/wix3112rtm
	-> wix311.exe and install to default location

 - install the latest version of msys2: follow instructions on website
 - install mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
 - also install:
	mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3
	mingw-w64-x86_64-adwaita-icon-theme
	mingw-w64-x86_64-gstreamer
	mingw-w64-x86_64-gst-plugins-base
	mingw-w64-x86_64-gst-plugins-good
	mingw-w64-x86_64-gst-plugin-gtk

 - build software
	(in top level source directory):
	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make

 - if the software build was successful
	(in this directory):
	(optional) edit make-installer and update the version number
	run: ./make-installer.bat

	in case the this fails, first verify that WiX is indeed
	installed in C:\Program Files (x86)\WiX Toolset v3.11,
	otherwise edit "make installer" and set the correct path
	(near top of file)

	if the installer was created successfully, you should find the
	.msi file in the msys /tmp directory, typically located in
	C:\msys64\tmp
