we do not provide a dmg, so for now, to build it from source:

install homebrew:

/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

install packages prerequisites:

brew install automake
brew install libtool
brew install pkgconfig
brew install gtk+3
brew install adwaita-icon-theme


either get the sources (this or newer version) from:

https://www.univie.ac.at/radio/files/radtel-src-v0.0.26.tar.gz

and unpack:

cd Downloads
tar zxvf radtel-v0.0.26.tar.gz
cd radtel


or clone repository from github https://github.com/aluntzer/radtel
and enter the directory.


To build, first, export a missing path for pkgconfig:

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig

now configure build:

./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr/local

and make:

make -j8

on success:

sudo make install

to run the client, issue

radtel

from the command line


to run the server with the simulator plugin (default configuration),
first download a data pack:

https://www.univie.ac.at/radio/files/sky_vel.dat.gz

OSX appears to unpack the file by itself (at least when downloaded with safari),
if you find there is still the .gz suffix, go to the files location and unpack:

gunzip sky_vel.dat.gz


To start the server/simulator run

radtelsrv

from the comand line in the directory sky_vel.dat is located
