we do not provide a dmg, so for now, to build it from source (from your terminal):

install homebrew:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

install packages prerequisites:

brew install automake
brew install libtool
brew install pkgconfig
brew install gtk+3
brew install adwaita-icon-theme
brew install gst-plugins-good
brew install fftw


either get the sources (this or newer version) from:

https://radio.univie.ac.at/
	-> radtel-src-v0.0.28

then:

cd Downloads

the sources may have been unpacked automatically, otherwise:

unzip radtel-src-v0.0.28.zip

then:
cd radtel

alternatively, you can also clone the repository from github:
	 https://github.com/aluntzer/radtel
and enter the directory


now configure build:

./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr/local

and make:

make -j8

on success:

sudo make install

to run the client, issue

radtel

from the command line


to run the server with the simulator plugin (default configuration),
first download a data pack:

https://www.univie.ac.at/radio/files/sky_vel.dat.gz

OSX appears to unpack the file by itself (at least when downloaded with safari),
if you find there is still the .gz suffix, go to the files location and unpack:

gunzip sky_vel.dat.gz


To start the server/simulator run

radtelsrv

from the comand line in the directory sky_vel.dat is located


NOTES:

- if you accidentially miss the "--prefix..." argument to "configure", and
  re-issued the command, sure to "make clean" before continuing at "make -j8"
- if you run into errors like
  GLib-GIO-ERROR **: Settings schema 'org.uvie.radtel.config' is not installed,
  try the previous point, otherwise start radtel with:
  XDG_DATA_DIRS=/usr/local/share radtel
